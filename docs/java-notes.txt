
At root of project
mkdir .jdk

Download Java17 JDK

File:
jdk-17.0.15_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz

Place this file in the .jdk directory.
Unzip the file. I did it on the command line in WSL with:

tar -xzvf jdk-17.0.15_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz

The -xzvf options for tar mean:

x - Extract/expand
z - unzip before extracting/expanding
v - verbose; list each file
f - from the following archive file

You will then have your JDK located at:
/.jdk/jdk-17.0.15/

This is for development and for running Java code locally, in the IDE or in a local
shell (terminal) and it is to assist the IDE (Intellij Ultimate in my case) for purposes
of static analysis, code compleation, real-time assistance and documentation and many
other features.

TODO: These instructions are only approximate. The actual flow, location and names of
 these things are slightly different. Update later using the actual IDE:
 It's all under project structure and you just locate the first setting and the rest populates.

INTELLIJ ULTIMATE - CONFIGURE SDK/JDK

Open your project in IntelliJ Ultimate.

Go to File > Project Structure (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S).

Under Platform Settings > SDKs, select to add a new JDK in the pulldown.

Choose the path: your-project/.jdk/jdk-17.0.15

Under Project Settings > Project, set the Project SDK to the one you just added.

IntelliJ will index and use this SDK for builds, code assistance, etc.
